#Modbus Slave (version 7.5.1 and earlier) mbs file has a buffer overflow vulnerability
##Description
When mbslave.exe opens a file of type mbs, it does not check the length of the content, causing the length of the content to exceed the default buffer size of the program. It can overwrite the structured exception handler (SEH) address in the stack and execute arbitrary code.

Version: V7.5.1 build 1742 and earlier
